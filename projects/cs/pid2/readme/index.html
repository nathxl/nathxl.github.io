<p>To simulate a particle system, we need to first create an array of particles with an initial state.
Each particle must have a fixed mass, an initial position in space and an initial velocity.
Then we have to start the main loop of the simulation where, for each particle, we have to compute the force that is currently acting on it, update its velocity from the acceleration produced by the force, and then update its position based on the velocity we just computed.</p>
<p>A rigid body naturally rotates around its center of mass, and the position of a rigid body is considered to be the position of its center of mass.</p>
<p>Since a rigid body can rotate, we have to introduce its angular properties, which are analogous to a particle’s linear properties. In two dimensions, a rigid body can only rotate about the axis that points out of the screen, hence we only need one scalar to represent its orientation. We usually use radians (which go from 0 to 2π for a full circle) as a unit here instead of angles (that go from 0 to 360 for a full circle), as this simplifies calculations.</p>
<p>Rigid body :</p>
<ul>
<li>theta (angle)</li>
<li>omega (angular velocity)</li>
</ul>
